        It’s hard to put into words all that Liennette’s partnership has done
        for us. Every critical business decision was put through the “Liennette
        Lens” because we know she will see us through to success. DOCUmation’s
        family approach runs through the lineage of our relationship with
        Liennette. She protects our family unit and has become a trusted and
        faithful advisor. Liennette’s work ethic and standards fall deeply in
        line with those of DOCUmation. We feel her passion and true desire to
        serve our family’s interest which is a foundation that DOCUmation
        strives for every day to do the same for our customers.

        Liennette is a successful businesswoman with a proven track record in
        corporate, start-ups, investment funds and asset portfolios. When she
        started NextGen, we knew we needed the mentorship from Liennette on our
        side. Her collaboration and insight will be crucial fundamentals we can
        pass to this generation of young executives. We owe a lot of thanks to
        Liennette for the years of extraordinary service.
