        Liennette Chung was hired as the CFO for one of my clients in 2005. I
        was involved in the hiring process. Her qualifications were outstanding
        as she had a broad background In making high dollar financial decisions.
        Little did I know at that time that I was meeting a high capacity person
        who would have a tremendous impact on my professional life. For a number
        of years, I observed Liennette build powerful admin and operations teams
        that increased the production of the entire company. Sales and service
        people alike respect her. Then in 2012 we joined forces in Building
        Quality Organizations through our Consulting Practice. Liennette’s
        principle area of financial expertise has benefited many of our clients
        and greatly impacted their profitability. She has maximum respect from
        all level of individuals and with all the companies we work with. I have
        learned much from Liennette not only in the financial realm but also
        about total business decisions and investments.

        She's has a strong read on people and is extremely insightful. Our
        clients often defer to Liennette in hiring and developing their
        executive team.

        Little did I know when I met Liennette 15 years ago the tremendous
        impact she would make in my life and eventually the tremendous impact
        she would have on our clients, their families and businesses. It has
        been a growth producing and fun ride. I look forward to many more years
        being associated with Liennette.
