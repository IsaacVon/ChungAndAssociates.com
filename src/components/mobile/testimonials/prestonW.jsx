          It’s hard to put into words all that Liennette’s partnership has done
          for us. Every critical business decision was put through the
          “Liennette Lens” because we know she will see us through to success.
          DOCUmation’s family approach runs through the lineage of our
          relationship with Liennette. She protects our family unit and has
          become a trusted and faithful advisor. Liennette’s work ethic and
          standards fall deeply in line with those of DOCUmation. We feel her
          passion and true desire to serve our family’s interest which is a
          foundation that DOCUmation strives for every day to do the same for
          our customers.

          Liennette is a successful businesswoman with a proven track record in
          corporate, start-ups, investment funds and asset portfolios. When she
          started NextGen, we knew we needed the mentorship from Liennette on
          our side. Her collaboration and insight will be crucial fundamentals
          we can pass to this generation of young executives. We owe a lot of
          thanks to Liennette for the years of extraordinary service.
