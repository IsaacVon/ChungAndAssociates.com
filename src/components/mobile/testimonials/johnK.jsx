          I have worked with Liennette Chung on many projects since 2012.
          Liennette has done M & A valuations, business planning and financial
          analysis for my company. Chung and Associates also did the valuation
          of my business and assisted in the sale of my business.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are building, buying, or selling a company, Chung and
          Associates will provide maximum ROI!
